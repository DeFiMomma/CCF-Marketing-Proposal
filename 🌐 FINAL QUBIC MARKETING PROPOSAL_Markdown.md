- No website optimization
- No accountability structure

**5. Clarification on Early Funding Request**

## **Summary 
**The previous marketing proposal was funded at **0.0000001800 USD/QUBIC**. 
During the term, QUBIC's value decreased to **0.0000007848**, reducing real purchasing power. Combined with availability variance and tools expansion, the budget runway shortened. 
 
Two primary factors shortened the previous term’s operational runway:

### **QUBIC Price Decline**

The last proposal was funded at **0.0000001800**. 
The price declined to **0.0000007848**, reducing purchasing power for USD-denominated tools and expenses.

### **Availability Variance + Overspending**

Some roles did not contribute at the availability outlined in the proposal. 
One role exceeded approved compensation during the first payout cycle. 
Tools required premium upgrades. 
Combined, this reduced the runway faster than projected.

### **Outstanding Compensation**

The CMO has not received compensation since **October 15**. 
This unpaid amount is included transparently in this term’s request.

### **Future Mitigation Strategies**

- Dynamic budgeting buffers
- Volatility impact planning
- Simplified team structure
- Clear contribution-to-compensation alignment
- Improved accountability and oversight

**6. Current Budget Request (High-Level)**

### Team (2 months): $45,000 
Tools (2 months): $6,004.5294 
Paid Ads (incl. $1,000 giveaways/mo): $12,000 
Outstanding Compensation (from prior term): $5,000

### **TOTAL: **$68,004.5294 USD

### **QUBIC Needed:** 86,636,066,565.267046
